Hello! Thanks for stepping by!

My name is Michal Dymek, based in Rzeszow, Poland. I'm a Test Engineer. Currently testing mostly web-based applications, backend, REST APIs and performing penetration testing. Responsible for test planning, management, and execution. After work, I'm trying to learn new things, technologies, languages, and everything tech-related. As a result of a decision to start focusing on one thing fully, rather than pursuing everything in the same time, and not finishing anything I've decided to buy a domain, create my blog (currently static jekyll site) and start writing down the things I've learned so far. I hope it will help someone on their journey. Nice to meet you!

You can find me on Twitter:

And you can find my work on GitHub:

Although, there isn't much... but hey, everyone started from scratch, right?
